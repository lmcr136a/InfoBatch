## Experiments

To replicate the experiment in the paper, I conducted experiments with the following setup. Additionally, I conducted full batch experiments using the same configurations to compare the accuracy and running time with the baseline. I followed the default training configuration in the appendix of the paper, and the summary of the results is provided below.

| Dataset   | Model     | Batch                   | Test Acc | Total Training Time  | Total saved sample forwarding  |
|-----------|-----------|-------------------------|----------|----------------------|--------------------------------|
| CIFAR-100 | ResNet-50 | Full Batch (Baseline)   |  81.3%   |  7hours 22minutes         |      0                         |
| CIFAR-100 | ResNet-50 | InfoBatch               |  80.9%   |  5hours 32minutes         |      3085267                   |
| CIFAR-100 | ResNet-18 | Full Batch (Baseline)   |  80.26%   |  5hours 42minutes         |      0                         |
| CIFAR-100 | ResNet-18 | InfoBatch               |  79.1%   |  4hours 18minutes         |      3115353                   |
| CIFAR-10  | ResNet-18 | Full Batch (Baseline)   |  95.49%   |  5hours 39minutes         |      0                         |
| CIFAR-10  | ResNet-18 | InfoBatch               |  95.1%   |  4hours 4minutes         |      3661638                   |

For the CIFAR-100 / ResNet-50 experiments, the results of the InfoBatch can be found in Figure 3 -(a) in the paper. I conducted the experiment using the optimal parameter proposed by the paper, ùëü=50, and my result was similar to the accuracy of approximately 81 reported in the figure. While the accuracy of the baseline and InfoBatch are similar, InfoBatch reduced the number of samples and the time required for the experiment.

For experiments with ResNet-18, Table 1 in the paper shows the accuracy of InfoBatch, 95.1% and 78.1%, with CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 respectively. I also used ùëü=50, and my results were similar to the accuracy reported in the table above.
While the accuracy is slightly higher with the full batch cases, the difference is not significant. InfoBatch is notable for its shorter execution time and fewer training samples.

In this work, I have verified the results of several experiments presented in the paper. My experimental results showed little to no difference compared to those in the paper. Additionally, I conducted baseline experiments for each case to compare the accuracy and running time, which were not explicitly detailed in the paper. With more sufficient hardware resources and time, I would have experimented with a wider range of ùëü values and with the ImageNet dataset to compare their accuracies with those reported in the paper.

### To execute each experiment, run the following code in the terminal.

To run the CIFAR-100 / ResNet-50 experiment:
```bash
# Full Batch (Baseline)
python3 examples/cifar_example.py --model r50 --batch-size 256 --optimizer lars --max-lr 5.2 --delta 0.0

# InfoBatch
python3 examples/cifar_example.py --model r50 --batch-size 256 --optimizer lars --max-lr 5.2 --delta 0.875 --ratio 0.5 --use_info_batch
```

To run the CIFAR-100 / ResNet-18 experiment:
```bash
# Full Batch (Baseline)
python3 examples/cifar_example.py --model r18 --optimizer lars --max-lr 5.2 --delta 0.0

# InfoBatch
python3 examples/cifar_example.py --model r18 --optimizer sgd --lr 0.05 --max-lr 0.03 --delta 0.875 --ratio 0.5 --use_info_batch
```

To run the CIFAR-10 / ResNet-18 experiment:
```bash
# Full Batch (Baseline)
python3 examples/cifar_example_cifar10.py --model r18 --optimizer lars --max-lr 5.2 --delta 0.0

# InfoBatch
python3 examples/cifar_example_cifar10.py --model r18 --optimizer lars --max-lr 2.3 --delta 0.875 --ratio 0.5 --use_info_batch
```
